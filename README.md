# Personalized-Course-Recommendation-System
📌 Project OverviewFinding the right course in a sea of online content can be overwhelming. This project is a Personalized Recommendation Engine that suggests the most relevant courses to users based on their interests, skill levels, and learning goals.By utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Content-Based Filtering, the system ensures that learners spend less time searching and more time upskilling.🚀 Key FeaturesSmart Search: Instantly find courses across multiple categories.Personalized Dashboard: Tailored "For You" section based on user profile vectors.Content-Based Filtering: Uses metadata (tags, descriptions, level) to find similarities between courses.Similarity Scoring: High-precision matching using Cosine Similarity.Interactive UI: Clean, responsive frontend for an intuitive user experience.🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: PythonLibraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)Backend: Flask / FastAPIFrontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (or Streamlit)Dataset: Processed course data from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX.🧠 How It WorksThe system follows a standard Machine Learning pipeline:Data Preprocessing: Cleaning course titles, descriptions, and tags.Vectorization: Converting text data into numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).Similarity Matrix: Calculating the Cosine Similarity between course vectors.Recommendation Engine: When a user selects a course or input interests, the system identifies the "closest" vectors in the multi-dimensional space and returns the top $N$ results.📂 Folder StructureBash├── data/               # Raw and processed CSV datasets
